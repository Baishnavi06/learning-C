# 🚀 My C Programming Journey

Welcome to my C language learning repository! I am a 1st-year B.Tech Computer Science student, and this is where I document my progress as I learn the fundamentals of programming.

## 📌 About This Repository
This repository contains daily code snippets, exercises, and mini-projects I have written while learning C. My goal is to build a strong understanding of low-level programming concepts.

## 📂 Structure
I organize my code by concepts:
- **Basics:** Hello World, Variables, Data Types
- **Operators:** Arithmetic, Relational, Logical
- **Control Flow:** If-Else, Switch Case
- **Loops:** For, While, Do-While
- **Functions:** User-defined functions, Recursion
- **Arrays & Strings:** 1D/2D Arrays, String manipulation

## 📝 Learning Progress
Here is my roadmap for this semester:

- [x] Introduction & Setup
- [x] Variables & Data Types
- [x] Operators & Expressions
- [ ] Conditional Statements (If-Else)
- [ ] Loops & Iterations
- [ ] Functions
- [ ] Arrays
- [ ] Pointers (The tricky part! 🧠)
- [ ] Structures & Unions
- [ ] File Handling

## 🛠️ How to Run My Code
If you want to run these files on your local machine, you need a C compiler like GCC.

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPO-NAME.git](https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPO-NAME.git)

2. Navigate to file location::  
   ```bash
   cd folder-name
   
3. Compile and run (using GCC):
   ```bash
   gcc filename.c -o output
   ./output
